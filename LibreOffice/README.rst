Benchmarking LibreOffice Load Time
==================================

* Set "Macro Security" to "Low" on your machine (temporarily).

  - Tools->Options->LibreOffice->Security->Macro Security->"Low"

* Run "measure_openoffice_start_time.sh" script. It uses "sudo" internally to
  flush the cache.

Some scripts in this folder are borrowed from http://prefetch.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/openoffice/
